# GerryChainShapefileTest
Run tests to confirm that the Python &amp; Julia GerryChains produce the same adjacency matrices after reading in shapefiles

## Shapefiles
You can download shapefiles from [mggg-states](https://github.com/mggg-states). Download the `.zip` file located in any of the [state]-shapefiles repositories, and then extract in the root folder of this repository. You should see (at least) a `.shp` and `.dbf` file in the resulting folder. I've already included the shapefile folders from Indiana, Virginia, and Utah, all of which were downloaded from mggg-states.
